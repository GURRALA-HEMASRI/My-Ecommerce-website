# Project Overview

This application was designed to replicate the core workflows of a modern e-commerce platform with a clean separation between frontend presentation, backend business logic, authentication, and persistent data storage.

The implementation focuses on practical engineering principles including modular architecture, reusable components, secure authentication, API abstraction, state management, and database-backed workflows.

The platform supports end-to-end shopping functionality from product discovery through final order placement.

# Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

Frontend structure:

```bash
frontend/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── common/
│   │   └── layout/
│   │
│   ├── context/
│   │   ├── CartContext
│   │   └── WishlistContext
│   │
│   ├── data/
│   │
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── HomePage
│   │   ├── ProductsPage
│   │   ├── ProductDetailPage
│   │   ├── CartPage
│   │   ├── WishlistPage
│   │   ├── CheckoutPage
│   │   └── OrdersPage
│   │
│   └── App.jsx
```

Frontend engineering principles:

- Component-based architecture
- Reusable UI composition
- Context-based state management
- API abstraction
- Route-driven navigation
- Responsive interface design

---

## Backend Architecture

Backend structure:

```bash
backend/
│
├── config/
│   └── db.js
│
├── controllers/
│   ├── authController.js
│   ├── cartController.js
│   ├── orderController.js
│   ├── productController.js
│   └── wishlistController.js
│
├── middleware/
│   └── authMiddleware.js
│
├── routes/
│   ├── authRoutes.js
│   ├── cartRoutes.js
│   ├── orderRoutes.js
│   ├── productRoutes.js
│   └── wishlistRoutes.js
│
